These queries assume that there are tables called "projects", "project_contributors", "users", and "stars" with the relevant columns and relationships. 

1. Retrieve all projects that a Quality Assurance (QA) tester has contributed to:

SELECT p.*
FROM projects p
JOIN project_contributors pc ON p.id = pc.project_id
JOIN users u ON u.id = pc.user_id
WHERE u.role = 'QA Tester'

2. Count the number of projects that a QA tester has contributed to:

SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM projects p
JOIN project_contributors pc ON p.id = pc.project_id
JOIN users u ON u.id = pc.user_id
WHERE u.role = 'QA Tester'

3. Retrieve the top 5 most popular projects that a QA tester has contributed to, based on the number of stars:

SELECT p.*, COUNT(s.id) as star_count
FROM projects p
JOIN project_contributors pc ON p.id = pc.project_id
JOIN users u ON u.id = pc.user_id
JOIN stars s ON s.project_id = p.id
WHERE u.role = 'QA Tester'
GROUP BY p.id
ORDER BY star_count DESC
LIMIT 5
